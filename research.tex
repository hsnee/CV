\emph{Supervisor: Rachel Mandelbaum}


{\sl Institute for Gravitational Research, Univ. of Glasgow} \hfill Oct 2015 $-$ Present \\

\hspace{3 mm} LIGO $-$ I worked on gravitational wave data analysis, particularly on investigating potential gravitational wave signal from the sun emitted by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo. \emph{Supervisor: Matthew Pitkin}


{\sl Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham Univ.} \hfill Jun 2015 $-$ Sep 2015 \\

\hspace{3 mm} DESI $-$ I worked on fibre assignment in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)'s Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) group, investigating the impact of galaxy clustering on redshift incompleteness caused by galaxies that are not assigned fibres. \emph{Supervisor: Shaun Cole}
